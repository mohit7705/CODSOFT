# Image Captioning using CNN (ResNet50)

## 📌 Internship Task
**Task 3 – Image Captioning**  
CODSOFT Artificial Intelligence Internship

---

## 📖 Project Overview

Image Captioning is an Artificial Intelligence application that automatically generates a **textual description (caption)** for a given image.  
This project demonstrates how **Computer Vision (CNN)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** concepts can be combined to interpret visual content and convert it into meaningful language.

In this implementation, a **pre-trained ResNet50 Convolutional Neural Network** is used to extract image features, and a caption is generated based on those features.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the integration of **Computer Vision and NLP**
- Use a **pre-trained CNN (ResNet50)** for image feature extraction
- Generate a meaningful caption for a given image
- Build a working AI application suitable for real-world use cases
