---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand basic chatbot design
- Learn rule-based Natural Language Processing
- Implement conversation flow using conditions

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- If-Else Logic
- String Matching

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. User enters a message
2. Input is matched with predefined rules
3. Chatbot returns a response based on conditions

---

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
python chatbot.py

✅ Output Example
User: Hello
Bot: Hi! How can I help you today?

📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how basic NLP concepts can be used to build conversational agents using rule-based logic.
